# Accessibility
Web and software experiences should be accessible for everyone, regardless of abilities or impairments. Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides better user experiences for everyone.


## Categories
Disabilities can be thought of as a mismatch between one’s ability and one’s environment, and can be broken into three main types:


| Type          | Description     |
|-------------|-------------|
| Situational   | A person with typical vision might struggle to view their screen in a bright environment. Or, a person sitting in a library may be unable to watch a video with the audio turned on. |
| Temporary     |  A person with a broken wrist may not be able to type but will regain the ability when healed.      |
| Long-lasting  | This is what people typically think of when they hear “disability.”      |

### **How they experience an interface**
- May use a screen reader to experience interfaces.
- May rely on Braille output.
- Cannot be expected to use a pointer or mouse for input.
- May use screen readers, screen magnifiers, high-contrast modes, and/or monochrome displays.
- May have their browser font size adjusted to a larger setting.
- Will not be able to differentiate between some colors on an interface. That's why some app like Spotify put a dot near their action icons.
- Rely on non-color information to use an interface.
- May rely on captioning and other alternative representations of audio.
- May rely on keyboards, track balls, voice recognition, and other assistive technologies to interact with an interface.
- May not be able to use a keyboard, mouse, or other pointer.
- May have limited working memory and need information to remain visible throughout the completion of a task.
- May experience seizures when exposed to flashing content/rapid animation (epilepsy).

### **What designers should think about**
- Maximize the readability and visual clarity of content.
- Consider how relative proximity of information changes when a page is magnified.
- Follow [keyboard guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/keyboard-accessibility/) and test with a screen reader to ensure the page is read to the user in a logical order.
- Run your design through a color-blind simulator. If the design doesn’t work, try another approach. If you’re working in Sketch/XD, we recommend the [Stark](http://www.getstark.co/) plugin.
- To get a better understanding of the various low-vision disabilities, we recommend using the [NoCoffee](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nocoffee/jjeeggmbnhckmgdhmgdckeigabjfbddl) or [Spectrum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spectrum/ofclemegkcmilinpcimpjkfhjfgmhieb/related) Chrome plugin to preview websites.
- Design for good keyboard interaction, making sure all actions are keyboard accessible and efficient.
- Learn how to navigate using a keyboard and spend some time navigating the web, email, and digital products using only the keyboard.
- Designers should understand the danger of complex language, non-stopping or flashing animations and fundamental cognitive usability heuristics.


## Global standards
- [The A11Y Project](https://a11yproject.com/)
- [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) (W3C)‘s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an effort to improve the accessibility of the World Wide Web for people of all abilities.
- Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) contributors create and maintain [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (WCAG), which is the global accessibility standard.
