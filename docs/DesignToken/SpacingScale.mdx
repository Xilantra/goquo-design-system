# Spacing Scale
```import theme from '../src/Utils/Theme'```
or
```import { spacing } from '../src/Utils/Theme'```


## Introduction
Every part of a UI should be intentional including the empty space between elements. The amount of space between items creates relationships and hierarchy.

Use the spacing scale when building individual components. It includes small increments needed to create appropriate spatial relationships for detail-level designs. This scale is applied and used within all components.

More on constraint layout (for designers) on [Medium](https://medium.com/tap-to-dismiss/constraint-layout-for-designers-3c665cb4d074).



## Usage
Used for smaller, more refined spacing needs, specifically within the context of a component (i.e. the space between a label and a text input). Can be use on padding, margin, height, width  or anything.

```padding: ${theme.spacing[5]};``` <br />
```height: ${theme.spacing[4]};``` <br />
```width: ${theme.spacing[8]};```
