# Layout Scale
```import theme from '../src/Utils/Theme'```
or
```import { layoutScale } from '../src/Utils/Theme'```


## Introduction
The layout scale is used for arranging components and other UI parts into a full page layout. It has larger increments that are used to control the density of a design. Use the smaller layout tokens to create more dense compositions and direct relationships. Use the larger tokens to increase the amount of white space and to disassociate sections.

## Usage
Empty space — also known as white space — is important in design. It can be used to break up sections on a page or to help create focus on certain element(s). White space helps with information processing; too much dense information can be disorienting or overwhelming for a user. Sections of a UI are allowed to be dense, but the whole page should not be crowded; there should be white space to let the user’s eye rest.
